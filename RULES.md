# $1.5K in 6 Hours RL Zero to Hero Spring 2025 Workshop & Competition Series - Official Rules 

Presented by Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Club at The University of Tulsa (AI/ML@TU) 

## Definitions 

*AI/ML@TU’s $1.5K in 6 Hours RL Zero to Hero 2025 Workshop & Competition Series will be referred to simply as The Competition for the remainder of this document.*

*For the purposes of The Competition, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Beginner is defined as a TU student who has enrolled in a maximum of 1 machine learning-related course at The University of Tulsa or other institute of higher learning.*

## Background 

During the Spring 2025 semester, AI/ML @TU held a series of (4) 90-minute hybrid in-person/remote workshops from 12:00pm – 1:30pm on February 22 and March 1, 8, and 15. The workshops focused on teaching beginner-level reinforcement learning concepts, tools, and techniques. Slide decks were presented and shared along with code in a GitHub repository, and audio/video recordings of each workshop were made available. On Saturday March 15th after the final workshop session was delivered, the month-long Competition phase began wherein teams have until April 15th to build, train, and test their reinforcement learning car racing and multiplayer battlefield models’ performance.  

$1,500 in prizes will be awarded to the best RL models in each division, as well as to the best non-RL model in the Wildcard division. 

## Eligibility 

All University of Tulsa students are eligible to attend and view the workshops and participate in the competition. Students may compete solo or form teams of up to 3 members, contingent upon the number of competition participants. 

Only RL Beginners and teams composed solely of RL Beginners are eligible to receive the top 3 prizes.  

## Prizes: Race Car and Multiplayer Battlefield 

1st Prize RL: $300 x 2 

1st Prize Wildcard: $150 x 1 

2nd Prize: $200 x 2 

3rd Prize: $100 x 2 

Various runner-up prizes totaling $150 

## Participation 

University of Tulsa students - email aiml.club@utulsa.edu to join the AI/ML Club Discord channel!

All competition materials and session recording links can be found in this GitHub repo, including:

- Links in the README to approximately 6 hours of recorded workshop instruction sessions (delivered on 4 consecutive Saturdays in February and March of 2025) 

- Slide decks and sample code for each session 

- Links to the training dataset and code. Instructions for using the dataset are given in the recorded workshop sessions and code. 

## Task Definition & Judging 

Competitors will build and train Reinforcement learning models to compete in two competitions. First is a time trial for the Gymnasium racing environment, and second is a multi agent battle in the MAgent2 environment.  For the racecar, high score wins, and for MAgents2, each agent will output a score when played against each other, once on each team. The resulting cross-play matrix where each agent plays each other agent twice will be used to calculate an elo rating. The highest elo wins.  

Final submission of competition models is due at 11:59 PM CST on Tuesday, April 15 

For more information, join the AI/ML Club Discord channel at this link: TU AI/ML Club and ask questions. 

## Competition Deliverables, Requirements & Restrictions 

Participants will register their team and submission should contain:

1. A folder for each competition submission according to the github submission instructions, 
2. An informal report (~ 1 page) detailing the participants thought process, any notable trials and errors, and a basic description / explanation of their model. 

Both items are to be submitted via this form: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=PAH_1LdiZ0GST1vZPoIC0z85eZBVSDlNrvRCaZtRpNFUQ0QzNDVOQTZTUUtLRTJERjQzTkxKS1FQSi4u . 

Outside advice and guidance may be sought by participants, but models must be written largely by registered solo and team participants. Getting your RL expert friend to write your model, for example, is against the spirit of the competition and will be met with disappointment and disqualification : (  

Submissions considered for prize money must consist of RL or evolutionary computation models. Preprocessing the observation data is optional but encouraged. Models which do not utilize RL or evolutionary strategies may be submitted for the fun of the tournament, but they are not eligible for prize money  

Participants may use optimization techniques such as air-gapping, gradient clipping, up sampling, use of multiple models, etc. 

Models are limited to 12GB GPU memory and 16GB CPU memory and will run in a T4 Colab GPU instance.
